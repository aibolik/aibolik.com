About two weeks ago I started my own Android Course called __"Learndroid"__.

How did everything begin?

*First of all*, everything began from __Moneymaker's course__, which was held in our University. The *purpose* of that course is to *start a business from zero*. Our mentor said us to choose a niche. I thought about making sushi, selling roses, selling unique notebooks, and stopped on *Handling Android Courses*. I also had some competitor, who was handling *Web and iOS Courses*, but we did not intersect too much.

*Then*, I started promoting my course: created account on [instagram][1], made an advertisement on University's bulletin board. Here is my page now:

I was planning to start course on 10th of March, and by that time I had 3 students. I said "Okay, anyway, it is hypothesis test", and started my course. On 3rd day of the course, 5 more students joined, but 2 of them left. And I had _6 students_ at that time.

I took the course design from [Udacity's][udacity] course - _**Developing Android Apps.**_ And here is the **Mistake #1** - the course was a bit hard for beginners, I tried to modify it, take off some topics, so that it would fit their level. The level of this course is _Intermediate_, I should take for _Beginners_. **Mistake #2** was that I did not write _Prerequisites_.

Anyway, last day of the course I made a longer lesson, I finished course, made some conclusions, gave some directions to the future, made consultation about their projects. Although I had _some mistakes_ carrying course, in my opinion, I could **give value to my students** for the offered price.

I created Google Form, so that they could give some _feedback_. That form says they liked course and they have something to learn from course, and the price is quite good. Besides, I was writing _notes_ and kinda analyzing everything.

By the end, I felt satisfied. I am thinking about changing course format and other things. Even if I liked what I did, it is not okay for me to spend two hours a day. If took look from **_Moneymaker's prospective_**, it is not very good business. I mean, the way I did. It should have **scalability**. Actually, it does. But this plan shifts for some time, because I have other _projects and work_ to do.
