I rewrote my blog using Remix.run several months ago, but I faced an issue with **canonical links** when I started improving the SEO of my blog. After some research about this, I came to a perfect solution that lets me have **dynamic link** elements that absorb route data. Let me show you how I got to it.

## What is a canonical URL

<Callout>

Simply put, a canonical URL is used by search engines to determine the origin of the content. Suppose your blog post is available through `http://`, `https://` and/or `www.` URLs. In that case, it is highly recommended to put a canonical URL that follows some structure, so that search engines will mark other pages as duplicates and *give all the credits* to the original content.

Another popular reason to use canonical URLs is to **syndicate your content**. If you publish your post on your blog and third-party platforms(like medium.com, dev.to, etc.) Google will consider them as [duplicate content](https://moz.com/learn/seo/duplicate-content). It might hurt the ranking of your website but using the canonical URLs you can turn this on its head and get back again *all the SEO credits* to your website by setting up canonical URLs in third-party platforms. This blog post is not meant to explain everything about canonical URLs, so if you still have questions I highly recommend reading about it [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls).

## The problem with the Remix.run

Most likely, you have a template route like `blog.$slug.tsx` in your Remix application. I thought I could add canonical URLs using a [`links`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#links) function, just like this(assuming I return `canonicalUrl` in the route `loader`): 

```tsx
export const links: LinksFunction = ({ data }) => {

  return [{
    rel: 'canonical', href: data.canonicalUrl,
  }];
}
```

But TypeScript immediately turned me down and didn't accept having an object with `data` in parameters. Turns out `LinksFunction` does not have access to data returned by `loader` and we can't put there any *dynamic* content. 

## Solution: use `DynamicLinks`

So after some research on the internet about adding dynamic link elements to a page in Remix, I came to a solution using `DynamicLinks`. So, `DynamicLinks` is not something that comes from the [Remix.run documentation](https://remix.run/docs) it is rather a utility that can be built using Remix.run capabilities.

  Big thanks to [Sergio](https://twitter.com/sergiodxa) who implemented it in [remix-utils](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils) Open-Source library.

### How does `DynamicLinks` utility works

Let me show you the code and walk you through what is happening:

```tsx
export function DynamicLinks() {
  let links: LinkDescriptor[] = useMatches().flatMap((match) => {
    let fn = match.handle?.dynamicLinks;
    if (typeof fn !== 'function') return [];
    return fn({ data: match.data });
  });

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      {links.map((link) => (
        <link {...link} key={link.integrity || JSON.stringify(link)} />
      ))}
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

- First of all, we get the all matched routes using the [`useMatches`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#usematches) utility hook
- We look for our pre-defined `dynamicLinks` function in exported [`handle`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#handle) constant of each matched route and call it giving the route `data` as a parameter(if the function is defined by the route)
- After we collect links from all the matched routes, we simply render them

We can put this component in the root of the Remix app and it will work for all the routes that define `dynamicLinks` function in exported `handle` variable.

### How to use `DynamicLinks`

The usage of the utility is very simple. I define `dynamicLinks` function in my `blog.$slug.tsx` module and export it within `handle` Remix-defined constant:

```tsx
const dynamicLinks: DynamicLinksFunction<LoaderData> = ({ data }) => {
  return [
    {
      rel: 'canonical', href: data.canonicalUrl,
    },
  ];
}

export const handle = {
  dynamicLinks,
};
```

<Callout>
  Note that this code assumes that I return `canonicalUrl` from my `loader` function.
</Callout>

And then I just need to render `DynamicLinks` component in the root of the Remix application:

```tsx
import { DynamicLinks } from "remix-utils";

export default function App() {

 return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        {/** your head tags */}
        <DynamicLinks />
      </head>
      <body>
        {/** body tags */}
        <Outlet />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This results in having a dynamic canonical URLs in all of my blog posts(both client and server-side). E.g.:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://aibolik.com/blog/how-to-add-dynamic-canonical-links-in-remix-application"/>
```

That's it! I was upset in the beginning that `LinksFunction` does not support `loader` data(for sure, for some good reason), but I liked how Remix gives the flexibility to implement this kind of utility. There are more examples in the [Remix.run documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#usematches) about the `useMatches` utility hook, like implementing breadcrumbs for all the nested components.
