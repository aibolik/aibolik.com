How’s it going?

I was going to write this post last *two months*, but today is the day I have time and intention to write this post.

About two months ago, when I was on my winter holidays, I passed a course on [Udacity](https://udacity.com/), called *Developing Android Apps* built by Google. The course level is *intermediate*, and time needed to pass is ten weeks, assuming 6 hours per week. But I finished it in about 10 days.

Here in this post, I want to *conclude* what I have done and learned throughout this course. Actually, I was writing what I have learned in each big commit, in my [GitHub repo for this course](https://github.com/aibolik/Sunshine).

By the end of the course, we had a built application called Sunshine, that uses *Android’s best practices*.

Why to choose Sunshine? Because it has all functionality that more advanced application has, and we can see in practice many APIs, where and how they are used.

So, what I have learned new for me:

1. Implementing *Settings(Preferences) Activity* without imlpementing any UI
2. Using Fragments in two pane mode
3. *The most important thing I learned, Android Best Practice for Database Implementation(Using Contract-DbHelper- Provider scheme)*
4. And the *second most important thing - Using Services*
5. Also some small tricky things I did not know…

The more about each *my learning* you can learn [here](https://github.com/aibolik/Sunshine/commits/master), by reading each commit message and browsing [repo](https://github.com/aibolik/Sunshine).
