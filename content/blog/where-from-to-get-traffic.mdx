Hi, there!

About a month ago, one man came to our University and started handling one course called [“Moneymaking”](http://i-sprint.kz/)(thanks to our [Head of Information Systems Department](http://sdu.edu.kz/en/programs/5b070300-information-systems/) - *Mr. Meirambek Zhaparov*).

This man really knows how to *make money*, and he is teaching us about it. Thanks to this course I launched my courses on Android development. If someone is interested, [visit my instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/kursy_android/).

We call ourselves “Moneymakers”, and it is really *breathtaking*. Throughout this course I understood many things, and also it changed my mind, my views to some things.

In this post, I will be doing my homework on this course. The homework was to find *20 channels, from where we can get traffic*(he said their actual number is more than 200).
