### Hi, there!

Today, I am starting this blog and will write here frequently, as I can. I hope anyone, who visits my site will get some useful information for him/herself. The platform I am using called Jekyll. You can [read more about Jekyll here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The purpose of this blog:
- write some notes while I do what I do
- share what I do

<BlogImage
  imgProps={imgAttrs}
  caption="Welcome to my blog" 
/>

So, I think thatâ€™s it for now.
