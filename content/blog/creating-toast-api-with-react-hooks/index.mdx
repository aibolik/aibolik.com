In this blog post we will be gradually creating fully working Toast API and we will use advantages of React Hooks to create nicer hooks-supported interface. Full working example is available [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/awesome-engelbart-cwyqh?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark).

## Toast component

Let's start by creating simple Toast component. It should be simple nice looking box that renders some content. For simplicity of this application, let that content be just a text.

<Callout>
  I will use [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/) in this example for styling.
</Callout>

```jsx {1,3,5-9}
const Wrapper = styled.div`
  margin-right: 16px;
  margin-top: 16px;
  width: 200px;

  position: relative;
  padding: 16px;
  border: 1px solid #d7d7d7;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 10px 0px #d7d7d7;
  color: #494e5c;
`;

const Toast = ({ children }) => (
  <Wrapper>{children}</Wrapper>
);
```

Now we have basic Toast, you can test it out by rendering `<Toast>Example</Toast>` in your root component(`App.js`). 

## ToastContainer component

Usually, there can be several toasts at the same time and they are positioned at some corner of the page. Therefore, it makes sense to create `ToastContainer` component, that will be responsible for toasts positioning and rendering them in a sequence. 

<Callout>
  For simplicity, let's assume that toast notifications will always be rendered at top right corner. If you want it to be more customizable, `ToastContainer` is a right place for this.
</Callout>

Additionally, in order to not mess with z-index, it is better to render components like toasts somewhere up in a DOM tree. In our example we will render them directly inside `body` of the page. We can easily accomplish this using [ReactDOM's `createPortal` API](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).

```jsx
const Wrapper = styled.div`
  position: absolute;
  /* Top right corner */
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
`;

const ToastContainer = ({ toasts }) => {
  return createPortal(
    <Wrapper>
      {toasts.map(item => (
        <Toast key={item.id} id={item.id}>{toast.content}</Toast>
      )}
    </Wrapper>,
    document.body
  );
}
```

Inside of wrapper we render array of toasts. We assume that `toasts` is an array of objects with `id` and `content` keys. `id` is a unique ID of each toast notification that we will use later to dismiss it, and `content` is just a text.

## ToastProvider

We built `Toast` and `ToastContainer` components, but we will not expose them directly. Instead, we will expose them through `ToastProvider` component, that will be responsible for rendering and managing all toasts. If we were building some library or package, `ToastProvider` would be the one exported and exposed to its consumers(of course along with hooks). 

Since it should hold all toasts, let's use React's [`useState` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) to save and manage toasts array.

```jsx
const ToastProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [toasts, setToasts] = useState([]);
  
  // ...
}
```

`ToastProvider` will also use [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to pass helper functions down the tree: `addToast` and `removeToast`. 

### `addToast` function

This function should add toast object into `toasts` array in `ToastProvider`. So it's usage will look like this: `addToast('You friend John liked your photo')`. As you can see, it should take a string as an argument, that will end up being `content`. Assigning of ID will be responsibility of the function, therefore we need some way of tracking unique IDs. For simplicity, we can have global variable `id` that will be incremented on each function call. Let's see how the function would look:

```jsx
let id = 0;
const ToastProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // ...
  
  const addToast = useCallback(content => {
    setToasts(toasts => [
      ...toasts,
      { id: id++, content }
    ]);
  }, [setToasts]);
  
  // ...
}
```

<Callout>
  Note the usage of [functional update](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#functional-updates) of `setToasts`. We need to use that, since new toasts array is computed using previous state.
</Callout>

I used `useCallback`, as a small optimization. We don't need to recreate this function on every render, therefore we use `useCallback` hook. Read more about it in [React's hooks documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback).

### `removeToast` function

Contrary to `addToast`, this function should remove toast object from `toasts` array in `ToastProvider` component given the ID of a toast. Guess where this function should be called from... from anywhere where ID is known! Remember we added `id` prop to `Toast` component? We will use that `id` to call `removeToast`. Let's see this function's code:

```jsx
const ToastProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // ...

  const addToast = useCallback(content => {
    setToasts(toasts => [
      ...toasts,
      { id: id++, content }
    ]);
  }, [setToasts]);

  const removeToast = useCallback(id => {
    setToasts(toasts => toasts.filter(t => t.id !== id));
  }, [setToasts]);
  
  // ...
}
```

Very simple function - we just filter out the dismissed toast by its ID.

We are almost done with `ToastProvider` component. Let's put everything together and see how it would look:

```jsx
const ToastContext = React.createContext(null);

let id = 1;

const ToastProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [toasts, setToasts] = useState([]);
  
  const addToast = useCallback(content => {
    setToasts(toasts => [
      ...toasts,
      { id: id++, content }
    ]);
  }, [setToasts]);
  
  const removeToast = useCallback(id => {
    setToasts(toasts => toasts.filter(t => t.id !== id));
  }, [setToasts]);
  
  return (
    <ToastContext.Provider value={{ addToast, removeToast }}>
      <ToastContainer toasts={toasts} />
      {children}
    </ToastContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Nothing new in this code: we just added `ToastContext`, so that `addToast` and `removeToast` can be used anywhere down the React tree. Then we render `ToastContainer`, that will be rendered always inside `body` of page, thanks to [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html). And `children`, since `ToastProvider` is rendered at the top level of React tree(along with other providers, e.g. Redux's Provider, `ThemeProvider`, etc.).

### `useToast` hook

Finally we reached to creating our own hook, that will be exported along with `ToastProvider`. This hook is actually very simple and consists of only 2 lines of code. It's purpose is to make `addToast` and `removeToast` available with just a function/hook call. Without this hook, you'd use `addToast` and `removeToast` by importing `ToastContext` and usage of `React.useContext`:

```jsx
import { ToastContext } from './path/to/ToastProvider';

const Example = () => {
  const { addToast } = React.useContext(ToastContext);
  // ...
```

Let's implement this simple hook:

```jsx
export function useToast() {
  const toastHelpers = React.useContext(ToastContext);
  return toastHelpers;
}
```

We don't need to import `ToastContext` because this hook resides along with it in `ToastProvider` component. And now we can simply call it like this: 

```jsx
const { addToast } = useToast();
```

## Dismissing toasts with timeout

We can add toasts with `addToast` and now they need to be automatically dismissed. I think the right place for this is a `Toast` component, since it is aware of its own lifecycle and aware of ID sent to it as props.

We need to fire a `setTimeout` with a call to `removeToast` after delay. The best way we can do this is using [`useEffect` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect).

<Callout>
  Side note about `useEffect`: it will run passed callback function whenever one of dependencies changes. 
</Callout>

So, we will use `removeToast` and `id` in dependencies list for this *effect*, since everything used inside the function should be passed as a dependency. We assume(and know) that `id` and `removeToast` function won't change, that means the *effect* will only be called upon first render. Let's see how it looks in code:

```jsx
const Toast = ({ children, id }) => {
  const { removeToast } = useToast();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      removeToast(id);
    }, 3000); // delay
    
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timer);
    };
  }, [id, removeToast]);

  // ...render toast content as before...
}
```

<Callout>
  Note the [clean up function](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#cleaning-up-an-effect) in `useEffect`: we need to clean up timer, so that it won't cause errors in case of unexpected removal of component.
</Callout>

That's it! Now it works as expected. Feel free to play with the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/awesome-engelbart-cwyqh?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark).

If you want to go further and practice more you can try enhancing it by adding some more customisation. For example by configuring `delay`, render position, styling and more. Most likely `ToastProvider` is the best place for that, since it is exposed to consumer and renders all other components.
