If you are like me and love designing your website on your own, you probably faced the issue of choosing a **color schema** for your website. I used to use some websites like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to generate a color schema for my website. However, I always end up not liking the result, because it is hard to find the right matching of colors for each use case: website background, UI elements background, UI element properties' colors, borders, and more. I am not even talking about accessibility and dark mode. I am happy to share that I found a solution for all of my color-related problems: [**Radix Colors**](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

## Features of Radix colors system

Radix Colors is a very simple yet feature-rich color system. The colors in Radix are not designed to be customized, because they are already hand-picked to be harmonious and well-balanced. These are some features of Radix Colors:

- The accessibility is baked in
- It has a rich set of different color sets(including rich colors and grayscale)
- All the colors automatically support dark mode
- The documentation is very clear and gives guidance on which color scale to use for each use case

Let me show you how you could build your color palette for your website. 

## How to compose a color palette for your website

Designing is not one of my strengths. The reason I like Radix Colors is that I don't need to know much about **color theory** and other important aspects like **accessibility** and **dark mode**. Let me go through the steps, to set up a color palette for your website.


### Step 1: choose brand colors for your website

If you don't have a brand color for your website, choose one or more of the colors that Radix Colors provides. Use this little tool that I built especially for this post, to choose the colors that you like:

import { ColorChooser } from './color-chooser';

<ColorChooser />

<Callout>
  __*Note 1:*__ The background used for the button is not the only option, there are 12 steps for each color, and you can use whichever suits best for your use case.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  __*Note 2:*__ [This page](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/the-scales) from Radix Colors documentation contains all the possible scales(dark and light modes), while the example above is only for dark mode.
</Callout>


### Step 2: choose a grayscale colors

Almost every website needs a grayscale color, for things like text, borders, and backgrounds. Also, they are perfect as a contrast text color for headings. Here is another color picker to choose grayscale colors.

<ColorChooser grayscale />

  If you are struggling to choose the right combination, take a look at [Natural pairing](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#natural-pairing) section of the Radix Colors website. They give pretty good combinations to select from.

### Step 3: include your selected colors in your code

First of all, you need to install the `@radix-ui/colors` NPM package. You can do so by using one of these commands:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/colors
// or
yarn add @radix-ui/colors
```

Then you need to import them either into your CSS(using `@import`) or if you use CSS framework into its theme as color objects. Here is an example with `styled-components`:

```jsx
import { blue, indigo, gray } from '@radix-ui/colors';
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    ...blue,
    ...indigo,
    ...gray,
    // any other colors you want to add
  }
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

I personally import them using the `link` tag in the head of my HTML and then reference them using CSS variables. Since my website is built with the **Remix framework**, I can do it this way:

```ts
// in my root.tsx

import indigoDark from '@radix-ui/colors/indigoDark.css';
import mauveDark from '@radix-ui/colors/mauveDark.css';

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {

  return [
    {
      rel: 'stylesheet', href: mauveDark,
    },
    {
      rel: 'stylesheet', href: indigoDark,
    },
    // and more colors that I need
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: use the colors to your advantage

That is it. You can now use them when building any UI element. I have [Understanding the scale](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale) page bookmarked, whenever I need to think of colors for new UI components. It explains very well with examples of how to use each step of color for each use case. I [built a callout component](https://twitter.com/aibolik_/status/1544095371365842944?s=20&t=5O6mxEyGgNa0XJUxztTLMQ) that you saw on this page using the same guide.
