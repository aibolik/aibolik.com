### _Shortly..._

I am a Software Engineer from a Central Asian country called [**Kazakhstan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan). I am doing software development professionally since **2016**, though I wrote my first lines of `C++` code back in 2008 when I started preparing for ACM contests. Currently, I work for one of those **F**AANG companies.

### _A little more..._

**For most of my life**, I lived in Kazakhstan. In 2017, I relocated first time to Belarus. I worked for a big outsourcing company called [EPAM Systems](https://epam.com/). And after 1,5 years I started looking for jobs in Germany and finally received an offer from a company called [Quandoo](https://www.quandoo.com/) and relocated to Germany in 2019. I lived there for 3 years with my family and experienced a [_worldwide pandemic_](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enDE990DE990&sxsrf=ALiCzsazyt6gYeMT3TH2oKgppmAgIuXnIw:1652651662263&q=COVID-19&si=AC1wQDAXKblb4YtxZaDquKpQ5Js55CVph8NS1FIwBhgs6qyyHpZ7b8dKUYIVU9f1MeIqkBT08lHR90TLux0tamIVl39sNT7jEg85LatFV1wbI9oH5iBOShY%3D&biw=1535&bih=1069&dpr=1) first time in my life. After some time, I decided to refresh my ACM knowledge and study some algorithms to get to FAANG companies. It resulted in getting an offer from Meta and relocating to the United Kingdom. This is how I relocated three times in 5 years. 

### _This website_

This is the **4th iteration of my website/blog**. I see it as a place to share something useful with my audience and at the same time a place to learn and do some creative stuff. I don't just rewrite it for no reason â€“ every time I was doing a rewrite I use new tools and frameworks to accelerate my learning. 

> I should probably document this iteration(here should be a link to a blog post). 

I hope you will find something interesting and useful for you. Thanks for checking in and happy exploring!
